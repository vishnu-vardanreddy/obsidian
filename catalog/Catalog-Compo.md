1. **Authentication**:

   - **User Registration and Login**:
     - Use **OAuth** (Google, Facebook) or custom authentication (email/password).
     - Secure logins using **JWT (JSON Web Token)** or **Session-based authentication**.
     - For multi-client authentication, utilize third-party libraries (e.g., Passport.js for Node.js, Django AllAuth for Python).
   - **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** for enhanced security.

2. **Payment Gateway**:

   - Integrate popular payment gateways like **Stripe**, **PayPal**, or **Razorpay**.
   - Support multiple payment methods (credit/debit cards, wallets, bank transfers).
   - Ensure compliance with **PCI DSS** (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) for securely processing payments.
   - Test transactions with **sandbox environments** provided by payment gateways before production.

3. **Multi-client Service Structure**:

   - **Microservices** or **Monolithic Architecture**:
     - You can design a microservices architecture for each client type or manage it through role-based authorization in a monolithic app.
   - **Client Subdomains**: Each client could have a subdomain (e.g., company1.example.com) or just different dashboards under the same domain.
