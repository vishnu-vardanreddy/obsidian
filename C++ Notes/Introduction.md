C++ supports both paradigms:

1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): C++ fully supports OOP concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

2. Procedural-Oriented Programming (POP): C++ also allows procedural programming, as it is an extension of C, which is primarily a procedural language.

C++ is often described as a multi-paradigm language because it allows programmers to use both OOP and POP approaches, as well as other paradigms like generic programming. This flexibility is one of C++'s key strengths, allowing developers to choose the most appropriate paradigm for their specific needs.

C++ is a general purpose language that is used many different aspects of building of the software's, like it can be used to built low level as well as high level languages , also used to design compilers and interpreters , also used for building operating software for process , kernels, threads etc.
